# Description Profile Project
In this first web application development task, the first part I made a basic frontend of my profile using text, photos etc using HTML and CSS, in the second part I developed the backend of the project, I used Flask a Python framework, to serve a static profile page. This basic function is achieved by defining specific paths within our Flask application, where the default path ('/') serves directly the index.html file from the templates folder, in the third advanced part of the project I added dynamic parameters in the "profile" function such as name, email, date and time, also a redirection was made in Flask, where the default path ('/') automatically redirects users to a specific path ('/profile'), improving the navigation structure of the website.
